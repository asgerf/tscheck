HIGH: high impact
LOW: low impact
FIXABLE: can be fixed without degrading the quality of the interface
UNFIXABLE: not fixable
REPEAT: caused by same bug in type interface
TYPO: bug is caused by a typo, e.g. writing "theshold" instead of "threshold"
METHOD: property should have been a method, e.g. foo:Foo, should have been foo():Foo.
FLAG: boolean flag should be optional; property is absent by default, implying the flag has its default value (usually false)
LOCATION: class/variable was in a different module
PLATFORM: warning due to platform-specific feature
INIT: warning due to feature not initialized yet (requires client-side function calls or events)
WHAT: there is no clear feature in the library this could map to. Could not determine what author was thinking when wrote this.
VERSION: part of interface describes something from a previous version of the library, which has now been removed/renamed/refactored
OPAQUE: an empty class or enum was used as a placeholder for an opaque type
IMPL: possibly a bug in the implementation or a documentation bug? (precludes fixable+unfixable)
